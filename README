# ia2

Author:Jackson Edwards
Interpreter 2 is an extension of a previous assignment iterpreter 1.
We are supposed to expand ia1 to add more functionality to it. 
This should include relationship operators, if then/else statements,
while loops, block statements and  read and write. 

#Usage 
use command javac *.java to compile all the java files. Then the
main is in interpreter.java. The test cases that I have made all 
pass but they have exception in thead message pring when some of 
them run. They still pass and this doesnt happen when run directly
from the console. Not sure how to fix this or if this is even a problem.
